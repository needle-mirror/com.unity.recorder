![Recorder](Images/RecorderSplash.png)

>[!NOTE]
>To use the Recorder package, you must install it separately from the Unity Editor. For detailed information about package requirements and installation instructions, refer to [Installation](installation.md).

Use the Recorder package to capture and save data from your Unity project in **[Play mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html)**:

* Capture gameplay or a cinematic and save it as a video file, as an animated GIF, or as a sequence of separate image files.

* Capture accumulated sub-frames to get motion blur effect or path tracing convergence on the final recorded frames.

* Capture AOV render pass data from your Scene and save it as multi-part EXR files for further image compositing.

* Capture the movements of a targeted character or camera from your Scene and record them as an animation file.

* Capture audio from Play mode to save it as a separate WAV audio file.

>[!WARNING]
>The Recorder is designed to work only in the Unity Editor in Play mode. It does not work in standalone Unity Players or builds.
