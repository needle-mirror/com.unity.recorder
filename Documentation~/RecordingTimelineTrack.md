# Timeline Recorder Track and Clip interface

Recorder Tracks in Timeline allow you to create Recorder Clips that automatically activate recordings at specific time or frame intervals of the Timeline in Play mode.

## Recorder Tracks and Recorder Clips

To set up a recording in Timeline, you must add at least one **Recorder Track** with at least one **Recorder Clip** in it.

### ![](Images/Label-A.png) General recording properties

The Recorder Clip's **Clip Timing** properties control the recording's **Start**, **End**, and **Duration**.

>[!NOTE]
>The **Frame Rate Playback** property is locked to **Constant** mode, because Timeline plays back at a constant frame rate. Also, the Recorder Clip inherits its **Frame Rate Target** setting from the Timelineâ€™s **Frame Rate** setting.

Select the type of Recorder you want the Recorder Clip to use.
