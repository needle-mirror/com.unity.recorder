# Movie Recorder properties

The **Movie Recorder** generates videos in the H.264 MP4, VP8 WebM, or ProRes QuickTime format. Movie Recorder also generates GIF files.

This page covers all properties specific to the Movie Recorder type.

>[!NOTE]
>To fully configure any Recorder, you must also set the general recording properties according to the recording interface you are using: the [Recorder window](RecorderWindowRecordingProperties.md) or a [Recorder Clip](RecordingTimelineTrack.md#recorder-clip-properties).

The Movie Recorder properties fall into three main categories:
* [Input](#input)
* [Output Format](#output-format)
* [Output File](#output-file)

## Input

Use this section to define the source of your recording.

|Property||Function|
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Source** ||Specifies the input for the recording.|
|| Game View |Records frames rendered in the Game View.<br/><br/>Selecting this option displays the [Game View source properties](#game-view-source-properties). |
|| Targeted Camera |Records frames captured by a specific camera, even if the Game View does not use that camera.<br/><br/>Selecting this option displays the [Targeted Camera source properties](#targeted-camera-source-properties).|
|| 360 View |Records a 360-degree video.<br/><br/>Selecting this option displays the [360 View source properties](#360-view-source-properties).|
|| Render Texture Asset |Records frames rendered in a Render Texture.<br/><br/>Selecting this option displays the [Render Texture Asset source properties](#render-texture-asset-source-properties).|
|| Texture Sampling |Supersamples the source camera during the capture to generate anti-aliased images in the recording.<br/><br/>Selecting this option displays the [Texture Sampling source properties](#texture-sampling-source-properties).|
| **Flip Vertical** ||When you enable this option, the Recorder flips the output image vertically.<br />This is useful to correct for systems that output video upside down.<br /><br />This option is not available when you record the Game View.|
| **Render Frame Step** || Available when you set **Playback** to **Variable**. Specifies the number of rendered frames to discard between recorded frames. The duration of the discarded frames is preserved, reducing frames per second. Example: if the value is 2, every second frame is discarded, but the duration of the recording remains the same. |
| **Accumulation** || Available if your project uses [HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest).<br /><br />Enable this feature to render [multiple sub-frames](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@10.3/manual/Accumulation.html) for accumulation purposes.<br /><br />See [Accumulation properties](#accumulation-properties) below. <br />For set up and use cases, see [Recording Accumulation](RecordingAccumulation.md).<br /><br />**Note:** Enabling the **Accumulation** feature might slow down your recording process considerably as it involves more rendering steps.|

### Accumulation properties

>[!NOTE]
>The use of the **Accumulation** feature is subject to very specific conditions:
>* Your project must use [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest).
>* You can only select **Game View** or **Targeted Camera** as the **Source** for the recording.
>* You can only use one active Recorder at a time when you capture accumulation.

## Output Format

Use this section to set up the media format you need to save the recorded images in.

|Property|Function|
|:---|:---|
| **Encoder** | The encoder to use for the recording. Each encoder has a specific set of properties:<br />• Select [Unity Media Encoder](#unity-media-encoder-properties) to generate an H.264 MP4 or VP8 WebM video.<br />• Select [GIF Encoder](#gif-encoder-properties) to generate an animated GIF.<br />• Select [ProRes Encoder](#prores-encoder-properties) to generate a video file encoded with an Apple ProRes codec.<br /><br />**Note:** To integrate a custom command line encoder such as FFmpeg and make it available from this list, use the [**Custom Encoder: FFmpeg**](samples-custom-encoder.md) sample provided along with the Recorder package. |
| **Include Audio** | Enable this option to include audio in the recording when the **Encoder** supports it. The Unity Media Encoder supports Mono or Stereo audio recording. The ProRes encoder supports Stereo only.<br/><br/>To enable recording when Include Audio is selected, in **Project Settings** > **Audio** > **Default Speaker Mode**, ensure that  **Mono**, or **Stereo** is selected.<br/><br/>**Note:** If you include audio, during recording, the audio signal is sent to the Recorder, not to your system's audio output. |
| **Include Alpha** | Enable this property to include the alpha channel in the recording. Disable it to only record the RGB channels.<br/><br/>This property is not available when the selected **Codec** doesn't support transparency, when the **Source** is set to **Game View**, or when Movie Recorder is used as a camera input to the Universal Rendering Pipeline ([URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest)). |

### Unity Media Encoder properties

| Property | Function |
|:---|:---|
| **Codec** | The video codec to use to encode the output file.<br /><br />The **Unity Media Encoder** includes **H.264 MP4** and **VP8 WebM** codecs.<br /><br />**Note:** Encoding with H.264 MP4 codec is not supported on Linux. |
| **Encoding quality** | The quality of the output movie: **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.<br />The lower the quality, the smaller the file size.<br /><br />Select **Custom** to set up specific quality properties. |
| **Target Bitrate** | Custom value for the bitrate the encoder tries to average throughout the video, in Mbps. |
| **GOP Size** or<br />**Keyframe Distance** | Custom value for the interval between two full images ([I-frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_compression_picture_types)). |
| **Encoding Profile**<br />(H.264 MP4 only) | Custom encoding profile: choose **H.264 Baseline**, **H.264 Main**, or **H.264 High**. Each [encoding profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding#Profiles) defines a different set of capabilities and constraints on which decoders rely. |
| **B-Frames**<br />(H.264 MP4 only) | Custom value for the number of bidirectional predicted frames ([B-frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_compression_picture_types)). |

>[!TIP]
>See Youtube's [Recommended upload encoding settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccontainer-mp%2Cvideo-codec-h%2Cframe-rate%2Cbitrate) for H.264 MP4.

### GIF Encoder properties

| Property | Function |
|:---|:---|
| **Quality** | The encoding quality of the GIF file. A higher quality results in a larger file size. |
| **Loop** | Makes the generated file loop the frame sequence indefinitely. |

### ProRes Encoder properties

| Property | Function |
|:---|:---|
| **Codec** | The video codec to use to encode the output file.<br /><br />The **ProRes Encoder** includes a variety of [Apple ProRes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProRes) codecs: **ProRes 4444 XQ**, **ProRes 4444**, **ProRes 422 HQ**, **ProRes 422**, **ProRes 422 LT** or **ProRes 422 Proxy**.<br /><br />**Notes:**<br /><ul><li>Encoding with ProRes codecs is not supported on Linux and Windows Arm64.</li><li> The ProRes encoder does not support variable frame rate recording.</li></ul> |

## Output File

Use this section to specify the output **Path** and **File Name** pattern to save the recorded movie file.

>[!NOTE]
>[Output File properties](OutputFileProperties.md) work the same for all types of recorders.
