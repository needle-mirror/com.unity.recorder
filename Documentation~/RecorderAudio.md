# Audio Recorder properties

The **Audio Recorder** generates an audio clip in WAV format.

This page covers all properties specific to the Audio Recorder type.

>[!NOTE]
>* To fully configure any Recorder, you must also set the general recording properties according to the recording interface you are using: the [Recorder window](RecorderWindowRecordingProperties.md) or a [Recorder Clip](RecordingTimelineTrack.md#recorder-clip-properties).
>* Only Mono or Stereo recording is supported. To enable recording, ensure that, in **Project Settings** > **Audio** > **Default Speaker Mode**, either **Mono** or **Stereo** is selected.
>*  During recording, the audio signal is sent to the Recorder, not to your system's audio output.
