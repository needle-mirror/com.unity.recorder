# Record a video in Full HD MP4

Movie Recorder supports generating videos in the H.264 MP4, VP8 WebM, or ProRes QuickTime formats.

Use the following example to configure and record a video with the most common format (MP4), resolution (1920 x 1080), and aspect ratio (16:9).  For information on using other formats, see [Movie Recorder properties](RecorderMovie.md).

## Choose a recording method

Choose the recording method that corresponds to your expected recording workflow:
* [A centralized recording session with one or multiple recorders (via the Recorder window)](get-started-recorder-window.md), OR
* [One or multiple recordings triggered from Timeline (via Recorder Clips)](get-started-timeline-track.md).

## Select the recorder type

To record a video, you have to use a **Movie Recorder**.

## Configure the Input properties

Input properties define the source of the recording and its visual parameters.

1. For **Source**, select **Game View**. If you want to use a different camera, select **Targeted Camera** and select the camera.

2. For **Output Resolution**, select **FHD - 1080**, which is Full HD 1920 x 1080.

3. For **Aspect Ratio**, select **16:9 (1.7778)**.

>[!NOTE]
>If the Output Resolution and/or Aspect Ratio in the Recorder is different than the Game view resolution, the Recorder switches the Game view to the Recorder's resolution before starting the recording. After the recording ends, the Game view does not automatically revert to its previous resolution. If you need to revert this change afterward, use the **Aspect ratio** dropdown menu in the [Game view control bar](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html).

## Configure the Output Format properties

The Output Format properties define the media format to save the recorded frames in.

>[!NOTE]
>* The alpha channel is available for some encoders subject to the following conditions:
>   * The render pipeline is High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) or Built-in render pipeline.
>   * The source is not Game View. The other sources can support alpha.
>* To enable recording when Include Audio is selected, in **Project Settings** > **Audio** > **Default Speaker Mode**, ensure that **Mono** or **Stereo** is selected.

In H.264 MP4, you can include audio, but alpha is not available.

1. For **Encoder**, select **Unity Media Encoder**. H.264 MP4 is selected by default.

2. For **Encoding quality**, select **Low**, **Medium**, **High** or **Custom**. The lower the quality, the smaller the file size.

You can also configure the Movie Recorder to use a [custom FFmpeg encoder](samples-custom-encoder.md) to generate video.
