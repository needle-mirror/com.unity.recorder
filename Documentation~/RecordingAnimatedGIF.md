# Record an animated GIF

Configure an animated GIF in Movie recorder using properties in the Output Format section of the recorder.

All of the Input sources (Game View, Targeted Camera, 360 View, Render Texture Asset, and Texture Sampling) support animated GIFs. For information on using these formats, see [Movie Recorder properties](RecorderMovie.md).

## Choose a recording method

Choose the recording method that corresponds to your expected recording workflow:
* [A centralized recording session with one or multiple recorders (via the Recorder window)](get-started-recorder-window.md), OR
* [One or multiple recordings triggered from Timeline (via Recorder Clips)](get-started-timeline-track.md).

## Select the recorder type

To record an animated GIF, you have to use a **Movie Recorder**.

## Configure the recorder

1. In the Movie recorder, expand the **Output Format** section.

2. For **Encoder**, select **GIF Encoder**.

3. Specify the **Quality**. The lower the quality the smaller the file.

4. **Loop** is enabled by default. Disable Loop to stop automatic replay.

5. To include the alpha channel enable **Include alpha**.
