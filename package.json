    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Disallow `ActiveCamera` from being selected with SRP-based projects as a camera source.\n- Display an error when a Recorder is set to capture from a Targeted Camera in a project using URP 2D Renderer.\n- Prevent reset on HDCameras history when there is no change of resolution.\n- Output resolution `Match Window Size` is now labeled `Use Game View resolution` to reflect the associated behavior. It also shows the current resolution of the Game View.\n- Show a warning when the requested `Output Resolution` conflicts with the current Game View resolution as Recorder needs to force change the `Output Resolution` of the Game View for the recording.\n\n### Fixed\n- Ensure that camera's rotation is retained when recording monoscopic 360 views.\n- Ensure an alpha channel is added when the Editor targets a mobile platform.\n- FFmpeg sample: prevent performance issue during a recording when the CPU main thread takes longer than usual to process a frame. This can happen when the Play Mode is paused or when a scene is being loaded."
