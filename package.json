    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added error message in UI if full output file path exceeds 259 characters.\n- The AOV Image Recorder now supports recording multiple AOVs at once and writes multi-part EXR files.\n  - Added the option to export AOVs of each frame to a single multi-part EXR file or to multiple EXR files.\n  - On upgrade, AOV Recorder settings seamlessly translate the former single AOV drop-down selection into the corresponding new AOV checkbox.\n  - Added categories to AOV selection UI for improved conceptual grouping and multi-selection.\n  - Revised all AOV labels and added tooltips for each AOV and category.\n- The AOV Image Recorder supports additional compression options: Zips, B44, B44a, DWAA and DWAB.\n- Added a tutorial in documentation to set up a Unity project with API scripting for starting recordings via a command line.\n\n### Changed\n- Removed resolution automatic rounding to the nearest even number when Movie Recorder uses MP4 codec and \"Match Window Size\" output resolution.\n- Removed JPEG export option from the AOV Recorder.\n- The Ambient Occlusion AOV was outputting the contents of the occlusion material map. Now, the AOV outputs the result of the Screen Space Ambient Occlusion post-processing pass.\n- Removed two unnecessary composited Lighting AOVs (Diffuse Lighting and Specular Lighting) from the exportable AOVs.\n- Refactored the documentation around the two recording frameworks available and the different use cases provided as examples.\n- Updated the documentation architecture overall to improve navigation and findability.\n\n### Fixed\n- Prevent video output from being corrupted when generated via a Recorder Clip run through a Scene loaded in Play mode.\n- Ensure the project uses the right RenderPipeline settings at all time: quality RenderPipeline settings or default RenderPipeline settings.\n- Ensure that the status messages at the bottom of the Recorder window are always readable even if the window is small.\n- Fix the visibility of the Preset icon in Light mode."
